# TurtleWars-Karai-s-Revenge-1

A text based game currently under development, started on the 3rd month of my coding journey. Variables are named after the 4 main characters of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. In this first iteration, due to limited coding knowledge a simple Random function is used to determine attacks and susequent damage done. 

Assigning specific attack stats and introducing new characters are examples of further development that will result in a more engaging plot and deeper character growth. Interested collaborators could help create a decision-based gameplay like in The Walking Dead franchise, also a permadeath mode would be a cool feature to add.
